## Business
According to [statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/9879/used-vehicles-in-the-united-states/#topicOverview) there is a USD 138.1 bn used car dealer market size in the US. The used car vehicle sales amount to USD 38.6M with an average selling price of \$30.7K per vehicle. Effective pricing and stocking strategies can help any used car dealership to sell effectively and maximize profits.
The goal for this project is to use the industry standard CRISP-DM methodology to analyze and model used car sales data and make predictions on car prices. The other goal is also to use those models to make clear recommendations to used car dealership about what consumers value in a used car and what factors drive price up or down.
