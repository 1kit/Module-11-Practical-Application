## Business
According to [statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/9879/used-vehicles-in-the-united-states/#topicOverview) there is a USD 138.1 bn used car dealer market size in the US. The used car vehicle sales amount to USD 38.6M with an average selling price of \$30.7K per vehicle. Effective pricing and stocking strategies can help any used car dealership to sell effectively and maximize profits.

Here I would like to use supervised machine learning methods to be able to model the price of used cars and attempt to evaluate the features that most contributes to the price of the car and make recommendations
